# Project Euler Problem Solutions

A personal repo for my solution code and occasional random musings
as I go through the problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

**If you want to avoid spoilers, I suggest clicking off of the repo**

## Disclaimer

Note: while I do plan to expand this soon with a test runner and maybe be slightly
more systematic about turning the more interesting thought processes into psots rather than dumping them into comments, this is at the moment not intended as a
learning resource.

That said, you might find the occasional interesting derivation or a clever data
structure use, whenever I see a problem that I deem interesting enough to warrant
not just brute forcing in the most straightforward way possible.

## Language choices

Really, it comes down to whatever I fancy at the time of opening the next problem, and I reserve the right to bust out even more esoteric stuff like Prolog if I feel like it, so the list will only ever expand.

That said I've spent my fair share of time racing in C++ so if something screams dynamic programming or just being very nitpicky about optimisation thnere's a highly likelihood it ends up there.

Haskell is just way too gosh darn elegant, so I have to restrain myself from just defaulting to it for everything.

Typescript is for when I'm feeling practical. Despite how much anything JS adjacent gets memed on, it strikes a great balance of just geting things done while still letting you get fancy with a pretty powerful type system if you're writing library code.

Python is the epitome of quick and dirty solutions. In this project I mean, I'm not implying it's as bad as perl in general. Though like JS, the accessibility does mean there's a lot of examples of bad code out there...

Anything else is me going, oh let's abuse another language for fun. Which I wholehardedly recommend everyone do more of occasionally.
